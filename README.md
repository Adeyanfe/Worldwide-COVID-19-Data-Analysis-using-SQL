## Worldwide-COVID-19-Data-Analysis-using-SQL
This repository contains SQL statements for analyzing COVID-19 datasets. The goal of this project is to explore and visualize various aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic using publicly available data. By leveraging data analysis techniques and visualization tools, we aim to gain insights into the spread, impact, and trends of the virus across different regions and over time. This project utilizes various SQL techniques, including joins, Common Table Expressions (CTEs), temporary tables, window functions, and aggregate functions to derive insights from the dataset. 
## Analysis Highlights
1. Descriptive Statistics: Calculating summary statistics such as total cases, and deaths both cummulatively and 
2. Data Visualization: Creating visualizations such as time series plots, and bar charts to visualize the spread of COVID-19, compare different regions, and track changes over time.
3. Correlation Analysis: Investigating correlations between COVID-19 metrics and factors such as population density, and poverty rate.
## Summary of Insights provided by the SQL Queries
1. Total cases and Deaths for each location: This query calculates the total numbers of cases and deaths for each unique location.
2. Country with highest death cases: This query reveals the location with the highest death cases. It provides insights into the countries most impacted by the virus.
3. Global cases Per day: This query presents the daily global COVID-19 cases, including the total number of new cases and new deaths, alongside the death rate as a percentage of new cases, providing an indication of the severity of the virus over time.
4. Continent with the highest death count: This query identifies the continent with the highest total number of deaths offering a broader perspective on the pandemic's overall impact.
5. Mortality Rate: This query computes the percentage of deaths relative to the total number of cases, providing insights into the severity of the virus across different locations and continents.
6. Percentage of Population Infected: This query determine the percentage of the population affected by COVID-19 by comparing total cases to population size allows us to evaluate the virus's spread in different regions.
7. Highest Infection Rate: This query identifies the country with the highest infection rate relative to its population and also, calculates the percentage of the population infected and highlights the most heavily impacted location.
In addition to the queries are views created to store the results of the analysis to be used for further exploration and data visualizations.
## Findings
1. Europe had the total number of deaths recorded as per continent, followed by North America, South America, and Asia.
2. Europe had the highest total cases per continent, followed by North America, Asia, and South America.
3. United states, Brazil, Mexico, and India recorded the highest deaths.
4. United satates, India, Brazil, and Russia had the total number of confirmed cases.
5. The findings from this analysis will help to contribute to making well-informed-decisions, allocation of resources appropriately and shaping efficient public health strategies.
